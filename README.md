# Modern docker-based SkyFactory 4 Minecraft server

You're probably thinking to yourself, "Oh great, ANOTHER SkyFactory 4 Minecraft Docker image!" Well, you're not
wrong. However, there's good reason why this image was built.

Searching Docker Hub for a SkyFactory 4 Minecraft server can be daunting. There are many already out there. However,
all of these haven't been kept up-to-date. The most recent ones were built sometime in 2022 and many others haven't
been built since 2019 or 2020. A lot of things have changed since 2019. We all lived through the COVID-19 pandemic
and on the security front hackers have relentlessly been at it. Docker images built so long ago are bound to contain
security issues. Container-level security fixes need to be kept up-to-date on a regular basis. Additionally, some of
the pre-existing images were built using a base container that no longer exists (thanks Oracle!). So even if you
wanted to rebuild those images without any other changes, you can't.

The aim of this image is to address these issues. Most importantly, this image is based on the well-maintained Java 8
implementation by Amazon called Amazon Corretto. Say what you want about Amazon, but there's a team of engineers there
working on Corretto and making sure that it's well maintained. And there are [published Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/amazoncorretto)!

This image will also be built regularly, probably monthly, so that the latest patches from the Amazon Corretto base
image can be pulled in. It doesn't look like SkyFactory 4 has had any updates since December 2021. But if a newer
version is released, know that this image will be updated to use it, and tagged appropriately so you can choose whether
you want to use it or not.

This image wouldn't have been possible without the work of others, namely:

Thank you! üôèüèª

Also, a major shout-out to [Geoff](https://github.com/itzg) who maintains perhaps the most popular dockerized Minecraft
server out there, [itzg/minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server). Thank you a million times
over!! üôåüèº

## Usage

To use the latest stable version, run:

```bash
    docker run -dit -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE -v <path to where you want to store data>:/data --name mcs-sf ghcr.io/simplicityguy/minecraft-skyfactory4
```

Note the `EULA=TRUE` parameter. This assumes that you as the end-user have read and agreed to the EULA. I do not take responsibility
for you agreeing to them if in fact you don't.

The `server.properties` file will be generated at first launch. You may modify this file with your own settings, but if you
do so, you must `docker restart mcs-sf`. [This](https://pingperfect.com/index.php/knowledgebase/937/Minecraft--How-to-Change-SkyFactory-4andsharp039s-Level-Type.html) is a good reference on the `server.properties` in case you need pointers on configuring your server.

It's a good idea to view the logs of the running container to get an idea of whether the server started correctly or not. To
do so, use `docker logs -f mcs-sf`.

There are a few common server settings exposed as environment variables, namely:

- `GENERATOR_SETTINGS`
- `LEVEL_NAME`
- `LEVEL_TYPE`
- `MOTD`

The Java VM options are also exposed as an environment variable. You may tweak these as necessary for your machine.

- `JVM_OPTS` (_default_: `-Xms4048m -Xmx4048m`)
